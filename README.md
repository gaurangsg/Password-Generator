# Password-Generator
The basic idea behind a password generator in Python is to leverage the  language's built-in functions and libraries to create a script that produces strong,  random passwords based on user-defined criteria. This may include the length of  the password, the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and  special characters.
